						transferring control
						of a Chickly NFT to the initial purchaser through the Services (“Initial Purchaser”), Chickly has no responsibility with respect to any
						Transaction. Chickly
						will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any third parties, nor will Chickly be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of
						your
						Transactions or any other interaction with any third parties. You understand that your Binance public address will be made publicly visible
