					<p class="popup-term-of-use__block-title">SMART CONTRACT ENABLED</p>
					<p class="popup-term-of-use__block-text">A Chickly NFT is a non-fungible Binance-based token (“NFT”) that uses smart contracts on the Binance
						blockchain (“Smart Contracts”). The Binance blockchain
						provides an immutable ledger of all transactions that occur on the blockchain. This means that all Chickly NFTs are outside of the control of any
						one party,
						including Chickly, and are subject to many risks and uncertainties. Chickly neither owns nor controls MetaMask, WalletConnect, the Binance
						network, your
						browser, or any other third party site, product, or service (including third party wallets or marketplaces) that you might access, visit, or use
						for the purpose
						of enabling you to use the Services or to purchase, list, auction, or sell Chickly NFTs (“Transaction”), and that, except with respect to
						transferring control
						of a Chickly NFT to the initial purchaser through the Services (“Initial Purchaser”), Chickly has no responsibility with respect to any
						Transaction. Chickly
						will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any third parties, nor will Chickly be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of
						your
						Transactions or any other interaction with any third parties. You understand that your Binance public address will be made publicly visible
						whenever you engage
						in a Transaction. Aside from transferring control of the Chickly NFT to the Initial Purchaser, Chickly has no control over the transfer, storage,
						ownership or
						maintenance of the Chickly NFT.</p>

						thereof) with or without notice. You agree that
						Chickly will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services, including in
						relation to any

						your digital wallet supported on MetaMask,
						WalletConnect or other wallet extensions or gateways as allowed on the Services (“Wallet”). Wallets allow you to purchase, store, and engage in
						transactions
						using the native Binance cryptocurrency, BNB. When you link your Wallet, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining
						the security
						of your Wallet and your control over any wallet-related authentication credentials, including any seed phrase or private cryptocurrency keys, as
						well as NFTs or
						cryptocurrencies that are stored in or are accessible through your Wallet. Any unauthorized access to your Wallet by third parties could result
						in the loss or
						theft of Chickly NFTs and/or other assets held in your Wallet and any associated wallets, including any linked financial information such as bank
						account(s) or
						credit card(s). Chickly is not responsible for managing and maintaining the security of your Wallet. Chickly has no responsibility or liability
